### Current Usage (Pre-Integration)

For now, you can use OmniAgent directly while we work on the Goose integration:

```python
from mcpomni_connect.omni_agent import OmniAgent
from mcpomni_connect.memory_store.memory_router import MemoryRouter
from mcpomni_connect.events.event_router import EventRouter

# Initialize memory store
memory_store = MemoryRouter(memory_store_type="redis")  # or "postgresql", "sqlite", "mysql"
event_router = EventRouter(event_store_type="in_memory")

# Create OmniAgent
agent = OmniAgent(
    name="my_agent",
    system_instruction="You are a helpful assistant that can answer questions and help with tasks.",
    model_config={
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "max_context_length": 50000,
    },
    mcp_tools=[
        {
            "name": "filesystem",
            "transport_type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/directory"],
        }
    ],
    memory_store=memory_store,
   event_router=event_router
)

# Run the agent
result = await agent.run("Analyze my project files and create a summary report")
print(f"Response: {result['response']}")
print(f"Session ID: {result['session_id']}")
```

### Self-Flying Background Agents (NEW!)

```python
from mcpomni_connect.omni_agent.background_agent.background_agent_manager import BackgroundAgentManager
from mcpomni_connect.memory_store.memory_router import MemoryRouter
from mcpomni_connect.events.event_router import EventRouter

# Initialize components
memory_store = MemoryRouter(memory_store_type="in_memory")
event_router = EventRouter(event_store_type="in_memory")

# Create background agent manager
manager = BackgroundAgentManager(
    memory_store=memory_store,
    event_router=event_router
)

# Create a self-flying background agent
agent_config = {
    "agent_id": "system_monitor",
    "system_instruction": "You are a system monitoring agent that checks system health.",
    "model_config": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "temperature": 0.6,
    },
    "local_tools": tool_registry,  # Your tool registry
    "agent_config": {
        "max_steps": 10,
        "tool_call_timeout": 30,
    },
    "interval": 60,  # Run every 60 seconds
    "max_retries": 3,
    "retry_delay": 30,
    "task_config": {
        "query": "Check system status and report any critical issues.",
        "description": "System health monitoring task"
    }
}

# Create and start the background agent
result = manager.create_agent(agent_config)
manager.start()  # Start all background agents

# Monitor events in real-time
async for event in manager.get_agent("system_monitor").stream_events(result["session_id"]):
    print(f"Background Agent Event: {event.type} - {event.payload}")

# Runtime task updates
manager.update_task_config("system_monitor", {
    "query": "Perform emergency system check and report critical issues immediately.",
    "description": "Emergency system check task",
    "priority": "high"
})
```

### Session Management

```python
# Use session ID for conversation continuity
session_id = "user_123_conversation"
result1 = await agent.run("Hello! My name is Alice.", session_id)
result2 = await agent.run("What did I tell you my name was?", session_id)

# Get conversation history
history = await agent.get_session_history(session_id)

# Stream events in real-time
async for event in agent.stream_events(session_id):
    print(f"Event: {event.type} - {event.payload}")
```

### Future Goose Integration

Once integrated with Goose, users will be able to:

```bash
# Configure OmniAgent capabilities
goose-configure --agent goose-omniagent-core

# Use memory-augmented agents
goose --memory-enabled --agent omniagent

# Create self-flying background agents
goose --background-agent system-monitor --interval 60

# Monitor events in real-time
goose --stream-events --agent system-monitor

# Update tasks at runtime
goose --update-task system-monitor --query "Emergency system check"
```

**The goal**: Make OmniAgent's advanced capabilities as easy to use as `goose-configure --agent goose-omniagent-core`!

### Current Status

**This is how OmniAgent works today** - a powerful, memory-augmented agent framework with advanced tool orchestration capabilities and **self-flying background agents**. The goal of **goose-omniagent-core** is to integrate these capabilities directly into the [Goose framework](https://github.com/block/goose) as a core extension, evolving Goose's native agent capabilities.

**‚úÖ ACHIEVED: Self-Flying Background Agents**
- ‚úÖ **Autonomous task execution** with configurable intervals
- ‚úÖ **Background agent manager** for orchestrating multiple agents
- ‚úÖ **Task registry system** for dynamic task management
- ‚úÖ **Real-time event streaming** for monitoring agent activities
- ‚úÖ **Runtime task updates** - modify tasks while agents are running
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready scheduling** with APScheduler backend
- ‚úÖ **Memory persistence** across background executions
- ‚úÖ **Tool orchestration** in autonomous environments

**Future Integration**: Once the Goose Grant is approved, this will become a native extension to Goose, allowing Goose users to leverage OmniAgent's memory, event streaming, advanced tool orchestration, and **self-flying background agents** directly within the Goose ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Approach

- **goose-omniagent-core** is designed to be integrated directly into Goose's codebase or as a first-class extension, not as a standalone plugin.
- All features (memory, events, tool orchestration, **self-flying agents**) are exposed natively to Goose agents and workflows.
